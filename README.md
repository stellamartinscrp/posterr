# Posterr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3. This project is focused on the front-end part. The back-end is mocked using 
`json-server` library. No database structure were developed, just json files with some primitive structure to help in the interations.

Some code (specially in the .service.ts codes) try to both do the request and simulate some data processing that in a perfect scenario should be done in the back-end.

## Run the project

1 - Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

2 - Run  `npm run api` to run the mocked back-end. It was developed using json-server library
